Improvements include support for the latest React Native versions,\nmany bug fixes, extra components, backward compatibility to Android SDK API 16 and more.\n\n> Please keep in mind this is still a work in progress. The master branch is subject to breaking changes.\n\nLooking for a demo app? [Check out the repo](https://github.com/react-native-material-design/demo-app).\n\nOr view it online [here](https://appetize.io/app/hyp1m20y515c16cj5yw2karcjg)! (Credits to Appetize for free hosting).\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm i react-native-material-design --save\n```\n\nCopy the `MaterialIcons` font file from [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#android) to your local working directory:\n\n`./node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/Fonts/MaterialIcons.ttf` -> `./android/app/src/main/assets/fonts`.\n\nImport any required components into your project, for example:\n\n```\nimport { Button, Card } from 'react-native-material-design';\n```\n\n> You may need to restart your packager in order for the icons to render.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation & full installation instructions are available at http://react-native-material-design.github.io\n\n## React Native 0.16+\n\nThis library only works with React Native 0.16+ due to the breaking changes with Babel and font loading it introduced.\n\n## Examples\n\n![Example 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/react-native-material-design/demo-app/master/resources/examples-1.jpg \"Example 1\")\n![Example 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/react-native-material-design/demo-app/master/resources/examples-2.jpg \"Example 2\")\n![Example 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/react-native-material-design/demo-app/master/resources/examples-3.jpg \"Example 3\")\n\n## Contributing\n\nFull contributing guidelines are to be written, however please ensure you follow the points when sending in PRs:\n\n- Ensure no lint warns occur via `npm run lint`.\n- Follow the Material Design [guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/layout/metrics-keylines.html#metrics-keylines-baseline-grids).\n",
